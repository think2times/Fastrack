### 1st
> I was faced the delimma whether leave or not last year. And I am still not know the answer. But I don't want to burning time, so I decided to review every evening from today. I had learned that slow is fast, less is more. I choose review as my first habit that I want to have. I was accustomed to reading novel all day the last year. I lost the target and don't want to learn or do anything harder. I would never do that again. I swear!

- Gratitude:
    - Mom cooked three delicious dishes and many dumplings
    - fancy dreams made me happy
    - walking made me feel better

### 2nd
> I watched two videos of Shui Qian Xiao Xi(Infomation Before Bed). They have made 1000 videos over the past 7 years in this series and their target is 10000. I think they are respectful because they progressively focus on the making China much better. I also find many problems in China and hope China will be better. But I didn't do anything except complaint. It's hard and very cool to hold on something useful for the society. Thanks for Chonghao Ren, the creator of this profound programme.

- Gratitude:
    - Shui Qian Xiao Xi(Infomation Before Bed)
    - snack in the Taibai Supermarket
    - dish washing
    - clean three shoes

### 3rd
> Today I gave a course for my student, made 2026 plan, returned two books, borrowed five new books and took a haircut. What a meaningful day! I felt I was in a good transition from the boring 2025. I will finish CSAPP, read 12 books and pass IELTS exam in the new year. I will quest my personal interest and cultivate more good habits. I hope I can find something more helpful and interesting to be a substitute for web novel. I have burninged too much time on it last year.

- Gratitude:
    - noon sleep
    - borrow books
    - haircut

### 4th
> Today is the first day to come back to work. It's hard to keep good mood especially that I have to work for six days. But I really did something, I learned CSAPP and PDA which both are very classical books. I not only read the book, but also tried to understand every notion that facilitated my study. I planned to finish the first three chapter of CSAPP before April. But I feel I can advance the schedule now. Because I have finished the 1.1 to 1.6 of CSAPP. Maybe I can finish the first chapter in this week.

- Gratitude:
    - GPU fan was automatically repaired in the morning, even though it made noises again in the afternoon
    - Ganmianpi
    - Lei Wang who gave me a PPT of revenue system

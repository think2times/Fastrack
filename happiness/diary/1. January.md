> I was faced the delimma whether leave or not last year. And I am still not know the answer. But I don't want to burning time, so I decided to review every evening from today. I had learned that slow is fast, less is more. I choose review as my first habit that I want to have. I was accustomed to reading novel all day the last year. I lost the target and don't want to learn or do anything harder. I would never do that again. I swear!

- Gratitude:
    - Mom cooked three delicious dishes and many dumplings
    - fancy dreams made me happy
    - walking made me feel better

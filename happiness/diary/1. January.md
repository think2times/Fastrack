### 1st
> I was faced the delimma whether leave or not last year. And I am still not know the answer. But I don't want to burning time, so I decided to review every evening from today. I had learned that slow is fast, less is more. I choose review as my first habit that I want to have. I was accustomed to reading novel all day the last year. I lost the target and don't want to learn or do anything harder. I would never do that again. I swear!

    - Mom cooked three delicious dishes and many dumplings
    - fancy dreams made me happy
    - walking made me feel better

### 2nd
> I watched two videos of Shui Qian Xiao Xi(Infomation Before Bed). They have made 1000 videos over the past 7 years in this series and their target is 10000. I think they are respectful because they progressively focus on the making China much better. I also find many problems in China and hope China will be better. But I didn't do anything except complaint. It's hard and very cool to hold on something useful for the society. Thanks for Chonghao Ren, the creator of this profound programme.

### 3rd
> Today I gave a course for my student, made 2026 plan, returned two books, borrowed five new books and took a haircut. What a meaningful day! I felt I was in a good transition from the boring 2025. I will finish CSAPP, read 12 books and pass IELTS exam in the new year. I will quest my personal interest and cultivate more good habits. I hope I can find something more helpful and interesting to be a substitute for web novel. I have burninged too much time on it last year.

- Gratitude:
    - noon sleep
    - borrow books
    - haircut

### 4th
> Today is the first day to come back to work. It's hard to keep good mood especially that I have to work for six days. But I really did something, I learned CSAPP and PDA which both are very classical books. I not only read the book, but also tried to understand every notion that facilitated my study. I planned to finish the first three chapter of CSAPP before April. But I feel I can advance the schedule now. Because I have finished the 1.1 to 1.6 of CSAPP. Maybe I can finish the first chapter in this week.

    - GPU fan was automatically repaired in the morning, even though it made noises again in the afternoon
    - Ganmianpi
    - Lei Wang who gave me a PPT of revenue system

### 5th
> 今天我上班居然忘了带手机，走到翰墨府的时候想听歌，摸了摸口袋发现都没有手机。我害怕回去拿会赶不上班车，想了下公司的电脑上微信QQ都登着，应该不至于耽误工作，所以就直接去等车了。一天下来，没有手机确实很不适应，上厕所没有手机玩简直是煎熬，中午午休也没敢下去，怕一觉睡过去，平时定的各种闹钟也都没了。不过省下的时间确实学了很多东西，csapp和tpp第一章直接看完了，学习时长远超前几天，算是因祸得福了。tpp确实是一本好书，感觉应该经常看，每次都感觉讲得很有道理，正好我手里有本纸质版的，随时都可以翻翻。csapp第一章看下来并不是很难，可能难点在于那8个实验，加油老己！

### 9th
> 漫长的一周终于结束了，现在我总是处于一种既觉得时间过得快又觉得它过的慢的矛盾状态下————上班的时候希望时间快点过去，真过去一周、一月又觉得什么都没干把时间浪费了。下午5点多，葛主任忽然通知我们书记要给我们部门开座谈会，让我们介绍了自己的学校、专业及负责的工作后，他就开始画大饼，前面说了很多很虚很没用的东西，后面谈到待遇，讲得反而很实在，最后讲到7点多才结束，葛主任帮我联系了总工办的赵东升主任把我捎回家。

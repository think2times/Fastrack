1. Getting up in the morning
    - The alarm clock rings!
    - Katherine: "Honey, it's 7 o'clock, time to get up."
    - James: "Okay, just a few more minutes."
    - Katherine: "No, You told me to make sure you <u>are</u>(were up) by 7."
    - James: "I know. But I can sleep till 7:30 if I don't take a shower."
    - Cathelin: "James, you know that's impossible! You have a meeting with your boss, and later with an important client."
    - James: "Christ! I almost forgot. <u>That would</u>(That's what) happens when I don't get enough sleep!"
    - Katherine: "Enough sleep? You went to bed at 10, that's 9 hours!"
    - James: "Do you have to be right all the time? But you are right, I'm getting up."
    - Katherine: "<u>Changping</u>(Jump in) the shower, that will make you feel better. And I'll make a pot of strong coffee. But, what do you want for breakfast?"
    - James: "Something simple. How about a bagel and <u>kunkies</u>(cream cheese)?"
    - Katherine: "No problem! It'll be ready before you are."
    - James: "Don't be so sure!"
    - Katherine: "Why wouldn't I be? You haven't beaten me yet!"
    - James: "True. But there is (a) first time for everything."
2. Breakfast
    - James: "Ah...The coffee smells great! Is that bagel ready? I'm starving."
    - Katherine: "It's ready just like it always is and just like I told you it would be."
    - James: "What would I do without you. You are the best."
    - Take <u>tips</u>(a sip) of coffee.
    - James: "And this coffee is pretty good, too."
    - Katherine: "We both know you just like me for my cooking."
    - James: "That's not so. In fact, I'm the one who made dinner (of) the last two nights."
    - Katherine: "Oh yeah. I guess that means it's my turn tonight."
    - James: "Only if you want to. I don't mind cooking once a day, especially when the weather is nice and I can barbecue."
    - Kahterine: "Okay, but let's get back to breakfast. Can I get you anything else?"
    - James: "A little more coffee would be great, with a little more sugar in (it) this time, please."
    - Katherine: "Sure, do you want another bagel or some fruit."
    - James: "No, thanks. I'm just not that hungry in the morning. You know that."
    - Katherine: "I know. But I was reading in the magazine that breakfast is the most important meal of a day."
    - James: "<u>I</u>(I've) heard that too. But I just can't force myself to eat when I'm not hungry."
    - Katherine: "Why don't I pack you a snack for later in the morning. You could eat it around 10 when you get hungry."
    - James: "That's a great idea. I always regret not eating breakfast right at 10 o'clock."
    - Katherine: "What shall I make?"
    - James: "How about a beer?"
    - Katherine: "James, be serious!"
    - James: "Okay, how about an apple and some cheese?"
    - Katherine: "That's better. Just give me a minute to get it packed."
    - James: "Take your time. I'm still early."
3. Driving to work
    - Katherine: "Here it is, James. Now get going. I don't want you to be late."
    - James: "Thanks, dear. I'll be home a little late tonight. Remember the client."
    - Katherine: "Okay, but call if you are going to be home after 10."
    - James: "I will. Bye!"
    - Katherine: "Bye!"
    - James gets in the car and leaves for work. He turns on the news.
    > "...and there was an accident <u>in</u>(on) highway 99. A truck turned over blocking westbound traffic for about 2 miles. Drivers on highway 99 west might want to take a local road to work this morning. The current time is 7:43 on this sunny morning and the temperature is 76 degrees. The weather forecast for late today is mostly sunny, with some clouds forming in the afternoon and (a) slight chance of showers in the early evening. We'll keep you updated with more traffic and weather throughout the day. But now, let's enjoy 45 minutes of commercial-free rock and roll!"
4. The gas station
    - James: "Damn, I'm almost <u>off the</u>(out of) gas!"
    - James <u>pushs</u>(pulls) into a gas station.
    - Oiler: "What can I do for you?"
    - James: "Fill it up with <u>the unlighted</u>(unleaded), please. And can you check the oil, too?"
    - Oiler: "Sure, pal."
    - <u>You</u>(He) opens the <u>heart</u>(hood) and checks the oil.
    - Oiler: "You are about a <u>quarter</u>(quart) low. Shall I put a <u>quarter</u>(quart) in for you?"
    - James: "Please."
    - Oiler: "You know you could really use a new set of tires. The ones you have are badly <u>warn</u>(worn). I <u>can</u>(could) do that for you right now. It wouldn't take more than 30 minutes."
    - James: "And the price?"
    - Oiler: "Well...that depends on how good a set of <u>tier</u>(tires) you want"
    - James: "No, I'm late for work anyway. I'll just take the gas and oil today. How much will that be?"
    - Oiler: "Let's see, 14 for the gas and 2.50 for the oil<u>. It's</u>(makes) 16 dollars and 50 cents."
    - James: "Do you take credit cards?"
    - Oiler: "Only Visa and Master Card, not American Express."
    - James: "Fine, here is my Visa."
5. Arriving at work
    - Steve: "Good morning, James. You are early. What's up?"
    - James: "Morning, Steve. Early is right. I've got two important meetings today. One with the boss, and one with the client. You're pretty early yourself, something important?"
    - Steve: "Yeah, I'm meeting a client too, someone from a big computer company. I think their headquarters are in Taiwan, but this guy runs <u>a</u>(the) New York office."
    - James: "Wang Computers. That's my client too. But I think <u>their</u>(the) owners are Chinese-American. I'm not sure if they <u>had</u>(even have) an office in Taiwan. I guess we are (working) on this account together."
    - Steve: "Good! To tell you the truth I was a little scared. The account is really big. It's just too much work for one man. See, what time do you meet with the boss, Mr. Barnes?"
    - James: "10:30, why?"
    - Steve: "I was right. We are on this account together. I am <u>schedual</u>(scheduled) to meet with Mr. Barnes at 10:30, too."
    - James: "Well then, partner, let's get busy parpering something for the meeting."
    - Steve: "Good idea. Where should we begin."
    - James: "I don't know about you. But I always begin big projects by going to the bathroom, and then with a hot cup of coffee. Can you wait for me?"
    - Steve: "Just hurry, I'll get the coffee ready."
    - James: "That sounds like an excellent plan."
6. Planning for the meeting
    - James: "I'm back."
    - Steve: "Here's your coffee. You feeling better?"
    - James: "I feel like a Champ. Where should we begin?"
    - Steve: "As always, it's best (to) begin at the begining. What have you prepared for your meeting with Wang?"
    - James: "Basically, I just have (an) outline of (a) presentation of our company's new software. I think our product is high quality and that the people from Wang will realize that once they hear <u>the</u>(a) description of it."
    - Steve: "Well, James. That's a little too simple. We know the product is good, but we have to convince <u>some</u>(them) of that too. Luckilly, I put together a video presentation on my notebook computer using our software. If they like the presetation, and I am confident they will, then that automatically means that they like our company's product."
    - James: "Steve, that's why you are at the top of sales. You think of everything in advance. I'm really just a computer software engineer. I can make the stuff, but I can't sell it."
    - Steve: "Of course you can't. That's why Mr. Barnes put us together. I'll take care (of) selling the software, and you can answer any tough technical question that the people from Wang might ask. I'm as bad at science as you are at sales."
    - James: "Steve, you are too modest. You are great at sales, but I know you know something about computers too. I still remember when we first <u>start</u>(started) working here you taught me a thing or two about Apple Macintosh computers."
    - Steve: "Sure, I know about MACs. But that's just because I used one through college. Plus, any dummy can use a MAC."
    - James: "I couldn't."
    - Steve: "Not at first. But after about 3 days, you <u>are</u>(were) already better than me."
    - James: "Okay, Okay, so I'm a computerner (nerd)."
7. The secretary
    - Steve: "I'll call my secretary <u>help to</u>(and have her) make copies of your outline."
    - James: "Are you sure that's okay? I mean, she doesn't really work for me. <u>Would</u>(What if) she get angry?"
    - Steve: "No problem. She works for me. And you and I (are) working on this project together. Watch and learn!"
    - Steve picks up the phone.
    - Steve: "Lisa, could you come (in) here, please?"
    - Lisa: "I can but I won't. It's only 8:55 and I don't start work until 9 O'clock."
    - James: "Well, Steve, I guess she knows who is the boss."
    - Steve: "Very funny. <u>We</u>(We'll) just have to wait for 5 minutes. That's all!"
    - James: "Whatever you say."
    - At 2 minutes after 9 O'clock.
    - Steve: "Do you think you can come in here now?"
    - Lisa: "Of course, Mr. Dawson. I'll be right in."
    - Lisa comes into the office.
    - Lisa: "What do you need, sir?"
    - Steve: "Could you make Mr. Goddard here about 20 copies of his outline?"
    - Lisa: "Why? Doesn't he have a secretary?"
    - A little angry.
    - Steve: "Of course he does. But we are working on <u>the</u>(a) project together. And I would really appreciate if you (would) just cooperate with me right now!"
    - Lisa: "All right, all right. You don't have to get mad. Did you say 10 or 20 copies?"
    - James: "Actually, 10 would be fine. It's a small group today."
    - Steve: "But I said 20, so make it 20!"
    - Lisa: "Yes, sir, Mr. Dawson."
8. Meeting the boss
    - Mr. Barnes calls Steve on the intraoffice phone
    - Mr. Barnes: "Dawson?"
    - Steve: "Yes, this is he."
    - Mr. Barnes: "Contact Goddard and come up to my office immediately. I <u>want to</u>(wanna) go over today's meeting in advance!"
    - Steve: "Mr. Goddard is with me now. We'll come up right away."
    - Steve to James: "Well, that <u>is</u>(was) the old man. It's show time. And <u>it</u>(he) sounds a little nervous, which means we have to be even more careful!"
    - James: "I'll be extremely careful. I just don't want him to <u>yelled</u>(yell at) me again. I'm an engineer, not a secretary."
    - Steve: "Be careful, some might hear you. Anyway, let's go!"
    - Steve and James go up to Mr. Barnes' office and the secretary sends them in. They knock on the door.
    - Mr. Barnes: "Come in."
    - James: "Good morning, sir."
    - Steve: "Good morning, Mr. Barnes. How are you?"
    - Mr. Barnes: "I'll be a lot better after this meeting is over. I hope you two have done your homework because this is a huge deal. If we can convince Wang about our company then larger computer firms will follow. I don't have to tell either of you that could mean <u>billions</u>(millions) of dollars. I'm counting on you."
    - Steve: "Don't worry, Mr. Barnes. Sir, you can depend on us. <u>Is not</u>(Isn't that) right, James?"
    - James: "Yes, I think. I mean of course you can!"
    - Mr. Barnes: "I had better be able to. And if you two do a good job, I won't forget (it) when it comes time for promotions either. I put you on this assignment because you are my two best men. I know you won't disappoint me. Well, let's hear about your ideas for the presentation. Goddard, would you like to start?"
    - James: "I think it might be best to let Mr. Dawson begin. He's <u>an</u>(the) expert at sales."
9. Going to lunch
    - Steve: "Wow, that went pretty well. Mr. Barnes <u>is</u>(was) easy today."
    - James: "Easy on you, maybe. I don't think he likes me."
    - Steve: "Don't be rediculous! He likes you, but he is a businessman like me and so I know how to talk to him."
    - James: "I'm not so sure."
    - Steve: "I'm sure that I'm hungry. Why don't we talking over lunch?"
    - James: "That sounds great! I'm starving!"
    - They walk outside the building to a restaurant.
    - Steve: "Do you like Italian food? This place is terrific."
    - James: "Like it? I love it. Let's go in!"
    - They sit down and look the menu for a while, then the waitress comes.
    - Steve: "What are your specials today?"
    - Waitress: "Today we have <u>toasted</u>(roasted) lamb and vegetable lasagne, I highly recommend lasagne."
    - James: "The lasagne sounds good. I'll have that."
    - Waitress: "And you, sir?"
    - Steve: "No. No vegetables for me. I want some meat. I'll try the lamb, please."
    - Waitress: "Also an excellent choice. Would you care for anything to drink?"
    - Steve: "Yes, I'll have a double martini."
    - James: "Steve, what about the meeting?"
    - Steve: "Oh. Yes. Better make that a mineral water."
    - James: "I'll have some <u>lawani</u>(lemonade), please. And could you bring us some bread to start?"
    - Waitress: "Of course. I'll be right back with that."
    - James: "I like this place. They have really good service."
    - Steve: "Just follow me and you won't go wrong."
    - James: "Not <u>was</u>(with) restaurants, at least."
10. The meeting
    - Steve: "Good afternoon, gentlemen. Today my colleague, Mr. Goddard and I will be introducing you to a revolutionary (new) software program. It combines all the functions of <u>every other's</u>(various other) programs <u>where</u>(-- word) processing, translating, financial management, graphic design and more -- into one. I will be leading the first part of the presentation, while Mr. Goddard will be answering technical questions at the end."
    - Mr. Wang: "I have a question from the beginning."
    - Steve: "Yes, please go ahead."
    - Mr. Wang: "I'm wondering about the price of your program? In other words, will it be cheaper to buy your product, or should we just buy all the others separately?"
    - Steve: "I'm glad you ask that question, Mr. Wang. I was going to <u>say</u>(save) this part until the end of the meeting, but since you asked, I will tell you. Our program is on average 40 percent less expensive than it would be to buy the programs it replaces separately."
    - Mr. Wang: "And what about after-service and upgrades?"
    - Steve: "All our products are guarantee for 1 year. As for upgrades, they were also free for 1 year and can be downloaded from the internet."
    - Mr. Wang: "I am also curious about compatibility with Apple computers. Do you have a separate product for Apple or ..."
    - Steve: "Perhaps my colleague should answer that, as it is more on (the) technical side."
    - James: "Mr. Wang, I develop this product to work on both PCs and MACs. I assume your company is mainly interested in PC version, but I assure you MAC users will not have <u>any</u>(no) problems with our product either."
    - Mr. Wang: "That's what I was afraid of. I want MAC users to have the problems. Otherwise they'll keep buying (from) Apple and not <u>for</u>(from) my company."
    - James: "I apologize, sir. But I can not help you with that."
11. With a co-worker
    - Co-worker: "Steve, James. How did the presentation go?"
    - Steve: "Don't ask."
    - James: "No, it wasn't that bad. Steve did really well. I think they are <u>so</u>(sold)."
    - Steve: "They <u>warrant</u>(were until) you told them we <u>are</u>(were) making the same product for the competitors. You never tell them that."
    - James: "I am sorry. But I can not lie just to make a sale. Maybe that's why I'm terrible at sales."
    - Steve: "Yeah, that's right. From now on, you just stick to <u>design in</u>(designing and) progrmming, and leave the selling to me."
    - Co-worker: "Don't be too hard on him, Steve. Mr. Wang might appreciate his honesty. Even (if) you have lied to him, he's a smart guy, especially when it comes to computers, and he <u>would probably</u>(probably would) know anyway. Now he knows you guys and our company are honesty. We'll just see what happens."
    - James: "True. And besides, Apple is really a tiny company when <u>compare</u>(compared) to all these PC giants. I don't think Mr. Wang feels <u>threaten</u>(threatened) by them."
    - Steve: "I'm sure we'll know soon enough."
12. <u>Back in</u>(Backing) the boss's office
    - Seeming quite upset.
    - Mr. Barnes: "I hope you two know what you have done."
    - James: "I'm sorry, Mr. Barnes. <u>It's</u>(It was) all my fault. Steve was doing just fine <u>and tell</u>(until) I <u>open</u>(opened) my big mouth. I take full responsbility."
    - Steve: "Yes, sir. I told him to keep quiet about that MAC stuff and just let me do the talking."
    - Mr. Barnes: "Is that so?"
    - James: "Yes, sir."
    - Now seeming quite happy.
    - Mr. Barnes: "Well, that's interesting since Mr. Wang <u>is</u>(has) just signed a contract to order 50000 units. Good job, Goddard. He said he was impressed both by your technical knowledge and your honesty. As for you, Dawson. We'll talk tomorrow. Right now, I'm too happy to think (about) anything negative."
    - Steve: "But, Mr. Barnes, sir."
    - Mr. Barnes: "That will be all."
    - James: "Come on, Steve, you can only make it worse by talking now. Goodbye, Mr. Barnes, and thank you."
    - Mr. Barnes: "No, thank you, Goddard. You did a fine job today. This company needs more men like you. We may be talking about (a) promotion soon. Now get out here."
    - James and Steve: "Yes, sir. Good-bye."
13. In the parking lot
    - Steve: "James, wait. I really want to say I'm sorry for my behavior before."
    - James: "Don't mention it."
    - Steve: "No, really. I did a <u>wrong</u>(a rotten) thing back there I just wanted to apologize."
    - James: "Forget about it. You are under a lot (of) pressure of the last few weeks, I know how important this project was to you."
    - Steve: "<u>Yes</u>(Yeah), but it was important to you, too, and I shouldn't have turned on you like that."
    - James: "Well, you may have a chance to make it up to me."
    - Steve: "How?"
    - James: "If I become vice president, I'll need my own good man to work for me."
    - Steve: "<u>Do</u>(Would) you do that for me?"
    - James: "Of course I would. I've seen your work, and you are very talented. Even today, you are much better prepared than I was. I just got lucky."
    - Steve: "It wasn't all luck. You have so much more technical knowledge than I do, and you'are not afraid to tell the truth."
    - James: "Exactly, and that's why, like today, we made a good team. <u>I</u>(I'd) hate to lose you, and I know the company would too."
    - Steve: "I'm not so sure about that after hearing Mr. Barnes today."
    - James: "That's nonsense. <u>He's</u>(He) just <u>trying</u>(tried) to scare you. And besides, if he's so happy with my performence, he'll have to listen when I tell him you're one of the best men at his company."
    - Steve: "I hope you're right."
    - James: "You know I'm right. Would you like something to drink?"
    - Steve: "Not only (would) I like it, I need it."
14. In the bar
    - Waiter: "What can I get for you, gentlemen, tonight?"
    - James: "I like a <u>gene</u>(gin and) tonic, please."
    - Steve: "Make mine a double scotch,straight up."
    - Waiter: "Did you have a rough day?"
    - Steve: "I don't want to talk about it. But let's <u>two</u>(just) say, you should keep the bottle close <u>the</u>(at) end."
    - Waiter: "I understand."
    - James: "Hey, where is my <u>gene</u>(gin and) tonic?"
    - Waiter: "Okay, Okay, just give a second here."
    - Bartender goes to make the drinks.
    - Steve: "Man, I just want to apologize (again) for ..."
    - Cutting Steve off.
    - James: "Stop! We are at (a) bar now, not (at) the office, and I don't want to talk about work. I said it was okay and I meant (it). If it's really still <u>bother</u>(bothering) you we can talk about it on Monday."
    - Steve: "You are right. I'll shut up now."
    - Returning with a drink (in) each hand.
    - Waiter: "Here's <u>gene</u>(a gin and) tonic for you, and (a) double scotch straight up for my friend <u>you have</u>(who had) the hard day. I hope <u>it</u>(this) helps."
    - Steve: "You know it will. James, <u>I</u>(a) toast to your coming promotion."
    - James: "No, you are getting ahead of yourself. First, let's drink to our successful <u>bill</u>(deal) today. Cheers!"
    - They touch glasses.
    - Steve: "Cheers, to a good day's work!"
15. Back at home
    - Katherine: "Wow, you are home early. It's only 8:45."
    - James: "(Yeah,) it was a strange day at the office."
    - Katherine: "Why? Did your presentation go poorly?"
    - James: "(No.) Nothing like that. In fact, <u>deed</u>(it) went really well. It's just that I had some trouble with a colleague."
    - Katherine: "Who?"
    - James: "Do you remember Steve Dawson?"
    - Katherine: "Let me think, didn't I meet him at the <u>Christ's</u>(Christmas) party?"
    - James: "Yes, that's him."
    - Katherine: "That's right. I told you to be careful when working with him. He seems so aggresive. What did <u>you</u>(he) do?"
    - James: "Oh, nothing really. I just thought we are supposed to be working together. But he seemed to be working against me."
    - Katherine: "I told you to watch out for him. I remember I said..."
    - Cutting her off.
    - James: "Yes, you told me. But I don't want to talk about it now. Tomorrow is Saturday and I just want <u>a</u>(to) rest. Besides, we haven't had much time <u>to gather</u>(together) either. How was your day?"
    - Katherine: "<u>Mine seems</u>(The same as) always. I like teaching, but sometimes the children are so wild."
    - James: "But they love you and need you, just like me."
    - Katherine: "Oh, stop. And anyway, I don't (want to) talk about my day either. Have you eaten?"
    - James: "<u>None</u>(Not) since lunch, you?"
    - Katherine: "I was waiting for you. I thought you might be home early."
    - James: "Great, what do you want?"
    - Katherine: "Let's order some Chinese food. I feel like staying at home and watching a video."
    - James: "Perfect!"

16. Getting up in the morning
    - The alarm goes <u>up</u>(off), but James is already up.
    - James: "Katherine, are you going to sleep all day or do I get some breakfast?"
    - Katherine: "Ah...what are you doing (up) so early? You never get up before me."
    - James: "I am so excited about the deal with Wang yestarday that I'm actually looking forward to going to work."
    - Katherine: "James, honey. It is so nice to see you happy about your job. I know how long you've been waiting for some recognition from your boss. Now look, your honesty and hard work are paying off."
    - James: "Well, are you just going to lie in bed? Why don't you make some eggs, toast and coffee while I take a shower?"

    - James: "Plenty. I wouldn't mind another cup of coffee, though."
    - Katherine: "You should eat a little more. It looks like you are going to have a big day of the office."
    - James: "You may be right. But I can't really think of food right now. I've <u>gotten</u>(got) too many other things on my mind."
    - Katherine: "I just don't want you to run out of energy today."
    - James: "Don't worry. I'll stop <u>by fun</u>(off on) the way <u>of</u>(to) the office at Dunkin Donuts and pick up a few donuts in case I get hungry between now and lunch."
    - Katherine: "Oh, James, donuts? Why don't you eat (a) more <u>new trash</u>(nutritious) breakfast? You are not (a) college kid anymore."
    - James: "You are right. But the fact is I love donuts, always have always will. Well, I should get going. I want to <u>go</u>(get) to the office a little early today. I have to figure out <u>the</u>(a) way to smooth things out between Steve and Mr. Barnes."
    - Katherine: "Okay, honey, have a good day. Ah, what time will you be home?"
    - James: "I have a feeling Mr. Barnes is planning to take us out to dinner tonight to celebrate yesterday's deal."
    - Katherine: "Would it do any good for me to ask you not to drink too much at the dinner tonight."
    - James: "Probabilly not."
    - Katherine: "<u>Ha,</u>(Hn...)I didn't think so. But you know I had <u>asked</u>(to ask) anyway."
    - James: "Don't worry, honey. If I drink tonight, I'll take a taxi home."
    - Katherine: "Okay, have a good day. I'll see you tonight."
    - James: "See you tonight."
18. At Dunkin Donuts

    - Waiter: "Good morning. Welcome to Dunkin Donuts."
    - James: "Good morning. Are the donuts fresh this morning?"
    - Waiter: "Yes, sir. We made them an hour ago."
    - James: "Good, in that case, I'd better pick up a few for the rest of guys <u>in</u>(at) the office. Do you have a special of I order more than a dozen?"
    - Waiter: "As a matter of fact, we're having a September Special. For every dozen donuts you order, we'll give you a <u>thirteen</u>(thirteenth) donuts free."
    - James: "In that case, give me a dozen chocolate and a dozen jelly filled."
    - Waiter: "Yes, sir. Here you are. <u>Would</u>(Will) that be all?"
    - James: "Also, would you fill my <u>thirms</u>(thermos) up with coffee? We have (a) coffee machine at the office, but it's not as good as your coffee."
    - Waiter: "There you are, sir. Two dozen donuts and one <u>thirms</u>(thermos) of coffee, that will be 6 dollars and 75 cents."
    - James: "All I have is <u>the</u>(a) 50 dollar bill, can you make change this early in the morning?"

    - James: "Good morning, Stacy."
    - Stacy: "Good morning, Mr. Goddard. Mr. Barnes asked to see as soon as you <u>get</u>(got) in."
    - James: "Did he say what (it) is about?"
    - Stacy: "No, but he said <u>he asked </u>(to ask) you to come up to his office as soon as you arrive. I assume it's about the Wang account."
    - James: "I'm sure you are right. Thank you, Stacy. By the way, I brought some donuts. Feel free to help yourself."
    - Stacy: "Mr. Goddard, you know I'm trying to watch my weight."
    - James: "I forgot. Anyway, why don't you put them out so everyone in the office can help themselves."
    - Stacy: "What's the special occasion? I don't recall you ever <u>bring</u>(bringing) donuts for <u>anyone</u>(everyone) before."
    - James: "Let's just say that <u>I meet</u>(I'm in) a good <u>new</u>(mood) today. Well, I'd better get up to Mr. Barnes's office. Wish me luck!"
    - Stacy: "<u>Great</u>(Good) luck!"
20. Mr. Barnes's office
    - James knocks on Mr. Barnes's door and enters his office.
    - James: "You <u>ask</u>(asked) for me, sir?"
    - Mr. Barnes: "Ah, Goddard, good. Come right in. Listen, I want to ask <u>a penny</u>(your opinion) of a few things. First, let me tell you again how pleased I am with the way you handled the Wang account. As you know <u>it</u>(this) is a huge account and it's going to require its own <u>manage</u>(management) team."
    - James: "Thank you, sir."
    - Mr. Barnes: "Wang Computers wants us to not only develop a new set of software for the new operating system we're designing for them, but they also want us to develop new marketing strategies for <u>the</u>(this) system. Something similar to what Apple did with their new line of Mactintosh computers. That was a brillient marketing idea <u>they</u>(to) build the processor right into the monitor. And you know how successful they were in developing great advertising for their new products."
    - James: "Yes, sir. Apple was able to regain their share of (the) market with the combination of (a) great product and good advertising."
    - Mr. Barnes: "Well, Goddard. I need <u>a</u>(the) team that can do the same thing for us and Wang Computers. I'm thinking of making you the man in charge of putting this team together and managing it. Do you think you could handle an assignment like that?"
    - James: "Do you mean that I can choose my own team?"
    - Mr. Barnes: "With my <u>approve</u>(approval) of course."
    - James: "Yes, sir. I think with the right people <u>work</u>(working) with me that I can make the most of our partnership with Wang Computers."
    - Mr. Barnes: "Good, that's what I <u>want</u>(wanted) to hear. I'm promoting you to the Executive Director in charge of the Wang account. Now, you are going to need a good assistant. Do you hanve anyone in mind?"
    - James: "Yes, sir, I do. Steve Dawson."
    - Mr. Barnes: "Dawson? (From) what I saw at the meeting yesterday, he didn't seem to be a team player. He <u>is</u>(was) looking <u>all</u>(out) for his <u>only</u>(own) interest."
    - James: "Well, yes. It did seem that way, but there are a few things you should know about Steve Dawson, sir. First, He has been with the company much longer than I have without promotion and the Wang account <u>is</u>(was) his big chance. That is why he was so aggresive. Second, when I came into the company, there were so many things that I didn't know. Steve was never selfish with <u>this</u>(his) time and he taught me a lot. Third, I think if he is given a chance, he can develop a great advertising package for the (new) system we are developing for our partnership with Wang Computers.Last but not least, Steve and I really work well together."
    - Mr. Barnes: "I must say I was impressed with your loyalty. All right then, I want you to take Dawson to lunch today and inform him of his promotion to Assistant Executive Director in charge of (the) Wang deal."
    - James: "Thank you, sir. I can ensure you that you won't regret your decision."
    - Mr. Barnes: "All right, Goddard. That's all, you can go."
    - James: "Yes, sir."
    - Mr. Barnes: "Oh, Goodard, one more thing."
    - James: "Sir?"
    - Mr. Barnes: "You can put the lunch bill on your executive expense account."
    - James: "Yes, sir!"

    - Steve: "James, yeah, I'm okay. How are you?"
    - James: "I am doing pretty well this morning, but you don't sound so good. Is something wrong?"
    - Steve: "Well, it's just <u>I'd</u>(I've) been worrying all night about what happened yesterday. I still feel terrible about <u>what I act</u>(the way I acted) in the meeting."
    - James: "Listen, I told you last night to forget about it."
    - Steve: "I know you did, but I can't get <u>all right</u>(over it so) easily. I really feel like I let you down yesterday."
    - James: "Look, do you have any plans for lunch today?"
    - Steve: "Nothing special, why?"
    - James: "Then why don't you let buy you lunch today?"
    - Steve: "Actually, I feel like I should buy you lunch."

    - Steve: "Bye."
22. At the restaurant

    - James: "Don't worry about that."
    - The waitress greets them.
    - Waitress: "Good afternoon. How many people today?"
    - James: "Just (the) two of us."

    - Waitress: "All right, follow me, please."
    - James and Steve are <u>sitted</u>(seated).
    - Waitress: "Here is our lunch menu with the specials listed on the right. I would especially like to recommend steak and lobster combination. The lobster is very fresh."
    - Steve: "I think I <u>would</u>(will) just have the soup (and) salad special, please."
    - James: "What are you talking about? Why don't we both <u>have</u>(get) the steak and lobster special? It sounds great!"
    - Steve: "But james, that will be a 60 dollars lunch bill. I know what your salary is, and you can't afford lunches like <u>these</u>(this)."
    - James: "Don't worry about it. This goes on company credit card."
    - Steve: "But we don't have company credit cards."
    - James: "As <u>up</u>(of) today, I have one."
    - Steve: "James, that mean you got the promotion."
    - James: "Let's order first, then I'll tell you all about it. Waitress, we like two of this steak and lobster specials."
    - Waitress: "Yes, sir. And how would you like your steak?"

    - Steve: "Make mine medium well, please."
    - Waitress: "Fine. Anything to drink today?"
    - James: "Yes, I believe we'll have two glasses of your best red wine."
    - Waitress: "Very good. Will that be all?"
    - James: "Yes, thank you."
    - Steve: "Would you tell me what's going on? I'm dying of <u>curiosity</u>(curiously)."
    - James: "I met Mr. Barnes this morning and we had a very interesting talk about the Wang account."
    - Steve: "What did he say?"
    - James: "Well, first of all. You are looking at the Executive Director in charge of the Wang account development team."
    - Steve: "Are you serious? Congratulations! James, you really deserve it. Wow! An executive position, I can't believe it."
    - James: "That's not all. Mr. Barnes thinks what this account really needs is not only technical support, but a new <u>promotion of</u>(promotional) strategy to emphasize (the) strengths of our software and Wang's operating system. My new job is to put together and supervise <u>a</u>(the) team to continue technical development and support. In addition, as I just mentioned, the team will have to come up with a new (and) innovative marketing strategy for the product."
    - Steve: "That all sounds great, James. I really happy for you. If I'd been just a little more (of a) team player, perhaps Mr. Barnes would promote me to the team as well. I guess I really missed my chance yesterday."
    - James: "Well, that is what I wanted to <u>tell</u>(talk) to you about over lunch today. Even <u>those</u>(though) things didn't go that well for yeou yesterday. I understand why it happened. I know how much stress you've been under (at) work to bring in a big contract."
    - Steve: "To be honest, I haven't been sleeping well because of the stress."
    - James: "Also, I remember how much you helped me when I first <u>join</u>(joined) the company. That is why I <u>wanted</u>(want) you to be my right-hand-man on the new team. Mr. Barnes autherized me to offer you the Assistant Executive Director's position." 
    - Steve: "You're not joking, are you? <u>You've been</u>(You're being) serious with me?"
    - James: "<u>I've been</u>(I'm being) totally serious."
    - Steve: "I can't believe it. This is the chance I've been waiting for. But, I don't understand, yesterday Mr. Barnes looked like he was ready to fire me. What changed his mind?"
    - James: "I don't think he was really that mad at you. But he did ask me who I wanted to be second-hand <u>commander</u>(command) on my team and I said (that) I wanted you."
    - Steve: "After yesterday, you would still do this for me?"
    - James: "Like I said before, I understand why you <u>act</u>(acted) the way you did yesterday. I also need your advertising expertise <u>for</u>(on the) team."
    - Steve: "I don't know what to say. This is the promotion I've been waiting for."
    - James: "Congratulation, Steve."
    - Waitress brings the food and drinks.
    - Waitress: "Here are your orders and drinks. Enjoy your meal."

    - James: "Well, I have been promoted to executive position and I'm going to need a secretary that can handle the pressure. Do you think you can do the job? Of course, there would be a raise with the new job."
    - Stacy: "Congratulations! Mr. Goddard! That's (a) great news. Of Course I would like to continue to work for you in your new position. And don't worry, I can handle it."
    - James: "Good, <u>let settle</u>(that's settled) then. Oh, just one thing, if I need you to start working before 9 O'clock, I hope you (don't) complain."
    - Stacy: "Of course, Mr. Goddard. You won't hear me complain."
    - James: "Good, then let's start packing for the move to our new office!"

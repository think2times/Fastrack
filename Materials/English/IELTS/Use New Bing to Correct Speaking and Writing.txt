Dear Anna,
I hope this letter finds you well. I want to tell you that I have moved to a new house last week.
It was so far between my former house and my company. I had to cost much time on traffic. Sometimes, I was late for work because I got up just a little more later than normal day. So I found a new house which is closer to my work place.
My current house locates by the White Lake road, it only takes 10 minutes when I go to work. From my bedroom, I can see the beautiful White Birds Lake. I always walk along the bank in the evening after dinner, there are many people selling snacks, fruits and sometimes toys. It's very interesting.
I'm really looking forward to catching up with you, especially as we haven't had a proper chat for such a long time. I hope you can come here and visit my house soon. I can introduce you many very delicious food and we can talk to each other about our recent situations.
See you then!
Dean

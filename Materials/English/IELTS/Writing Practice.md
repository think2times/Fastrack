### AI's 9 points model essay
> Dear Anna,
> I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to let you know that I have recently moved to a new house. The main reason for my move was the long commute from my previous home to my workplace. I often found myself spending hours in traffic and even being late for work on occasion.
> My new house is located on Baihu Road, just a short 10-minute drive from my office. It is a beautiful two-story building with spacious rooms and large windows that offer stunning views of White Birds Lake. In the evenings, I enjoy taking leisurely walks along the lake’s shore, where vendors sell all sorts of delicious snacks and trinkets.
> I would love for you to come and visit me in my new home. We could catch up on old times and explore the local area together. There are so many interesting sights to see and delicious foods to try.
> Looking forward to seeing you soon!
> Best regards,
> Dean
